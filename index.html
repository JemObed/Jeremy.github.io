        <h2>This Website will just focus on Pokemon</h2>
<p>Pokemon has been a part of my childhood and its game design and mechanics are what drew me to take a closer look as to how technology in our world works today. 
    But for my purposes here Iâ€™ll only be taking focus and shed light on the mechanics and expand when possible. 
    Pokemon is a game that boils down to all the many ways you can use and collect creatures called Pokemon. 
    You can hold 6 pokemon in a party with you at any given time. 
    You can hold even more inside virtual boxes that each hold up 3x the amount you carry in a party. 
    And have the potential to unlock a minimum of 16 boxes per any current game. 
    This allows you the space to store and collect your pokemon in any number of orders, quantity of any given individual pokemon, and rare classes of Pokemon. 
    The game design also includes combat between Pokemon in game to play the game your way. 
    So the game goes beyond simply completing the story and giving in to a new game. 
    I will list all the mechanic that I will focus this page to; the different types, different balls, Pokedex, Number of Pokemon that can be register to Pokedex, and combat.

    This image represents a Pokemon in each of the 6 slots for a full party that each one can be swapped in any order withing the party.
    so you can start with the one you want and switch to something in the back when the need arises.

       <h2>Pokemon Types</h2>
 <p>Pokemon are also known for having a Type element that characterizes them and gives them each a strength and weakness attribute according to each type. In total there are 18 ndividual types.
     It boils down to a game of rock, paper, scissor where one type can be more effective than the other, unlike rock, paper, scissor a super effective type over another does not equate to a total blow out for the other;
      just a state of multiplier advantage of 2x per typing.and the opposite is also true. In the following I will be provided an list of examples and their interactions bewteen one another.</p>
      <ul class='Typelist'>
        <li><img class='Types' src="file:///C:/Users/jerem/Documents/Pokemon%20Image/Normal.png" alt=""></li>
        <li><img class='Types' src="file:///C:/Users/jerem/Documents/Pokemon%20Image/Ghost.png" alt=""></li>
        <li><img class='Types' src="file:///C:/Users/jerem/Documents/Pokemon%20Image/Figthing%20.png" alt=""></li>
        <li><img class='Types' src="file:///C:/Users/jerem/Documents/Pokemon%20Image/Psychic.png" alt=""></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'll start by making this simple. Psychic is strong against fighting, Fighting is strong against normal, normal and ghost are immune to each other, and Ghost is stong against Psychic and this dynamic is only a fraction of connections made between type effectiveness against each other</p>
